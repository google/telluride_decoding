  """Use TF to compute the Pearson correlation between two sets of data.

  This works between two (multi-dimensional) feature arrays.  Like np.corrcoef,
  x and y are 1-D or 2-D arrays containing multiple variables and observations.
  Each column of x represents a variable, and each row a single observation of
  all those variables.
  From:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43834830/tensorflow-equivalent-of-np-corrcoef-on-a-specific-axis

  Args:
    x: First multidimensional array, n_observations x n_vars
    y: Second multidimensional array, n_observations x n_vars

  Returns:
    n_vars dimensional vector with the correlation of each pair of columns.
