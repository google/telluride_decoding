# The telluride_decoding Library

[This is a fork of the original project, as Google is no longer 
contributing to this project. This should be consided the official version.]

This repository contains Python/Tensorflow code to decode perceptual signals
from brain data.  The perceptual signals we are using are generally audio
features.  And the brain data is one of several types of signals, such as EEG,
MEG and ECoG. 

The Telluride Decoding Toolbox is geared towards large-scale decoding
experiments. You can
run small experiments in a colab. But this package keeps all the data in
files so the data doesn't have to fit into memory, and so it is easier to run
tens or hundreds of tests in parallel.

## License

This code uses the Apache License 2.0. See the LICENSE file for details.


## Purpose
This code builds and trains models that connect perceptual signals, primarily
audio, to brain signals, which can be EEG, MEG or ECOG. One common use for this
type of algorithm is to decode auditory attention, as shown in the figure below.

![Auditory attention decoding](doc/AuditoryAttentionDecoding.jpg)

In attention decoding, we wish to know which of two (or more) signals a user is
attending. One signal (the upward pointing blue arrow) indicates that the signal
is being processed by the entire brain and is "exciting" all areas.  Another
signal is heard by the auditory system, but is not attended, and doesn't
recruit as much of the brain. The two signals are processed differently, and
produce different brain signals.

This software helps to decide which signal the user is attending, by building
a model that uses the EEG signal, for example, to predict the intensity of the
attended audio signal.

## Documentation
Documentation to follow (but there are extensive comments in the code.) The
three primary parts of this code are:

* ingest: Use to read various kinds of file formats and transform the data into
TFRecords for use by the decoding program
* decoding: Used to build, train and test models that connect audio and brain
signals.
* infer: Use to run a model on real or test data.  This model can run in real
time.

## To install
To install this software you can execute this command, which will automatically
install the necessary prerequisites:

```
pip install telluride-decoding
```

This code builds and test with the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build software.
All tests pass on MacOSX as of March 22, 2024.

## Using this code
This library is written in Python3 and uses Tensorflow2. The
decoding code can be run as a standalone program, or as a library, or in 
a [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), a form of Python
wrapped in an interactive notebook.

There is a complete end-to-end codelab that describes how to use the programs
to perform attention decoding on a public dataset. With a Unix machine and
access to to GitHub you can verify that the code works and produces the same
results as we get at Google.  The codelab is here
[doc/DecodingCodelab.md](doc/DecodingCodelab.md)

One can also use the program as a library in a Colab. Colab allows one to
interactively ingest data, build models, and test their performance. Here is
an example:

* Telluride4: Ingest and test linear regression.
[colab](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/google/telluride_decoding/blob/master/Telluride_Decoding_Toolbox_TF2_Demo.ipynb)

Documentation on the standalone decoding program can be found
[here](doc/decoding.md). This version is useful in distributed environments,
where one might want to do a parameter search.  Each run of the program
tests one set of parameters.

The code uses CPU or GPUs, as available. TPU support is forthcoming.
